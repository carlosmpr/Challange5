    "    - `savings_data`: Use the list that you just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `columns`: Set this parameter equal to a Python list with a single value called `amount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `index`: Set this parameter equal to a Python list with the values of `crypto` and `stock/bond`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the `savings_df` DataFrame to plot a pie chart that visualizes the composition of the member’s portfolio. The y-axis of the pie chart uses `amount`. Be sure to add a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using Python, determine if the current portfolio has enough to create an emergency fund as part of the member’s financial plan. Ideally, an emergency fund should equal to three times the member’s monthly income. To do this, implement the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Create a variable named `emergency_fund_value`, and set it equal to three times the value of the member’s `monthly_income` of $12000. (You set this earlier in Part 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Create a series of three if statements to determine if the member’s total portfolio is large enough to fund the emergency portfolio:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. If the total portfolio value is greater than the emergency fund value, display a message congratulating the member for having enough money in this fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Else if the total portfolio value is equal to the emergency fund value, display a message congratulating the member on reaching this important financial goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Else the total portfolio is less than the emergency fund value, so display a message showing how many dollars away the member is from reaching the goal. (Subtract the total portfolio value from the emergency fund value.)\n"
